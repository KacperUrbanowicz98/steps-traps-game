# 🎮 Steps traps game

Escape the Traps is a simple terminal-based Python game where the player tries to safely reach step 100 without stepping on randomly placed traps.

## 🧠 Concept

The game randomly selects 3 numbers between 1 and 100. These are the trap positions. The player progresses by pressing Enter step by step. If the current step is a trap — the game ends.

It's a fun project for Python beginners to practice:
- Variables
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `break`)
- Random number generation (`random`)
- Basic I/O (`input`, `print`)

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the script with Python:
   ```bash
   python escape_the_traps.py

2. Press Enter to move forward.

3. Try to reach step 100 without triggering any of the hidden traps.

## 💡 Example Output

Press Enter to continue the game

1 is safe. Go ahead!

Press Enter to continue the game

Traps were in [13, 47, 89]
